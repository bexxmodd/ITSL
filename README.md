<h2>Welcome to The Repository of The Lab Exercises of ITSL</h1>

The lab works are performed in <font color=red>python jupyter notebook</font> and they follow:

<a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/index.html">An Introduction To Statistical Learning with Applications in R</a>

This is a great introductory book for people who are interested in machine learning. However, as the name of the books suggests all the application of the explained concepts and models are implemented using R statistical software. The goal of this project is to replicate all the lab works using Python language with an overview of steps performed and followed analysis and explanations. With the increasing popularity of the Python language due to its versatility and user-friendly syntax, lots of newcomers will try to learn machine learning using python and I hope these guides will be helpful. Book consists of 10 chapters and the lab exercises start from chapter three. This project follows the ITSL chapter by chapter.
